4. Refunds
Once we have accepted your returned merchandise, we shall refund the amount in Hong Kong dollars you have paid for the item.

Your refund, excluding initial shipping costs and tax and duties, will be credited to the account used to make the purchase. Please allow up to 3 weeks from the date of our receipt of the returned item(s) for the account to be credited.

If I return my international order, will I get refunded the local tax and duties I paid?
Unfortunately, we are not able to refund local tax and duties paid at checkout on deliveries to overseas destinations as these are charged by local governments. Certain countries operate schemes to reclaim any local tax and duties if you return goods and will require a specific application by you to your local government or authority.
