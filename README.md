## Attempt to run a LLM based chatbot locally

### Installation
You need to download the pre-trained LLM model `llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin` in https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin and put it into the root directory of this project if you want to run the notebook.
